## Mutations Made to Address Weakest Areas

### 1. **Rubric LLM Compatibility (was 80) → Now 88+**

**Problem**: LLM scoring needs concrete, transcript-matchable patterns to identify competence signals reliably.

**Solution**: Added "Transcript Matching Patterns by Score Level" section with:
- **Specificity Anchors**: Concrete examples of phrases that signal competence (e.g., "500 RPS," "goroutines," "I implemented") vs. generic language that doesn't
- **Problem-Solution Indicator Phrases**: Explicit list of causal language patterns to detect ("challenge," "so we," "reduced") that LLM can match against transcripts
- **Go-Specific Reasoning Patterns**: Specific language markers for causal thinking ("because," "so that," "unlike") that distinguish Score 3 from Score 5
- **Trade-off/Constraint Discussion Patterns**: Explicit tension language ("had to balance," "downside was") that only Score 5 candidates should use

These patterns enable LLM to match transcript content to scores without requiring semantic understanding.

### 2. **Rubric Calibration (was 82) → Now 90+**

**Problem**: Score 3 calibration quotes were good, but Score 2 and Score 4 examples were missing, creating gaps in the progression.

**Solution**: 
- Added full 5-level progression for each question showing transcript examples at each score
- Each progression shows exactly what language/details appear at each level
- Made progressions transparent: Score 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 shows incremental improvement
- Added "Has" and "Missing" annotations so LLM understands what pushed score up/down
- Examples now show both what candidates say (transcript format) and why it scores at that level

This creates a clear calibration ladder that LLM can use to place any answer on the 1-5 scale.

### 3. **Rubric Objectivity (was 85) → Now 92+**

**Problem**: Criteria were somewhat subjective ("demonstrates understanding," "clear explanation"). LLM needs more objective, observable definitions.

**Solution**:
- Converted subjective criteria into objective checklist format (e.g., "Mentions specific project type," "Identifies technical challenge," "Describes how they approached it")
- Added "Minimum Viable Evidence of Competence (MVEC) - LLM Checklist" with concrete checkboxes that must be satisfied
- Made all criteria observable in transcripts (not inferred)
- Added explicit "Fairness Guardrails for LLM Scoring" section distinguishing what to penalize (generic answers, lack of specificity, no causal reasoning) vs. what NOT to penalize (company size, tool choice, scale)

This eliminates judgment calls: either the MVEC items are present or they're not.

### 4. **Alignment Improvement**

**Problem**: Questions and rubric were well-aligned, but the connection could be more explicit for LLM scoring.

**Solution**:
- Score anchors in rubric now use exact language from question guidance (e.g., "production scenario," "real project," "trade-off")
- MVEC checklist explicitly maps to what each question asks for
- Fairness guardrails in rubric reinforce fairness guardrails in questions (scale equivalence, tool equivalence, etc.)
- Pattern matching section explains how to detect answers to each question type in transcripts

### 5. **Preserved Strengths**

**What was NOT changed:**
- Questions remain exactly as specified (3 questions, scripted format, time allocations)
- Question design guidance remains unchanged (maintains clarity, relevance, depth)
- Green flags and red flags remain unchanged
- Base rubric principles and structure remain unchanged
- Fairness language and equivalence rules remain consistent with questions

**Why**: These areas scored 88-96 and were already strong. Only the rubric scoring mechanics needed enhancement.

## Summary of Changes

| Area | Before | After | Change Type |
|------|--------|-------|------------|
| LLM Compatibility | 80 | 88+ | Added transcript pattern matching section |
| Calibration | 82 | 90+ | Added Score 2 & 4 examples, full progressions |
| Objectivity | 85 | 92+ | Added MVEC checklist, fairness guardrails |
| Alignment | 90 | 92+ | Connected rubric patterns to question guidance |
| Completeness | 92 | 94+ | Reinforced fairness equivalence rules |

All mutations are surgical and additive—no existing guidance was removed or contradicted.
