## Mutations Applied

### Addressing Rubric Objectivity (78 → improved)
**Problem**: Rubric criteria were likely too subjective and dependent on interviewer interpretation.
**Solution**: 
- Added "Transcript-matchable indicators" requirement to force concrete, observable signals
- Specified "minimum viable evidence of competence" for each question (what MUST be present)
- Added guidance to define criteria in terms of observable transcript elements, not general impressions
- Replaced vague language ("demonstrates knowledge") with specific requirements ("mentions specific feature AND explains purpose")

### Addressing Rubric LLM Compatibility (80 → improved)
**Problem**: Rubric criteria may not have been specific enough for LLM matching against transcripts.
**Solution**:
- Added requirement for realistic quote snippets at each score level (5, 3, 1) so LLM has concrete examples to match
- Specified exact patterns/phrases the LLM should detect (e.g., "mentions specific Go library by name")
- Added guidance to make score anchors comparative and measurable (Score 3 vs 5 differences)
- Required mapping between rubric criteria and actual transcript language patterns

### Addressing Question Coverage (82 → improved)
**Problem**: Questions may not have comprehensively covered all required skill areas.
**Solution**:
- Explicitly added three required coverage areas to question prompt: (1) hands-on project experience, (2) Go-specific concepts, (3) production/operational considerations
- Added requirement for "explicit coverage map" in output showing which question addresses which learning goal
- Added rubric guidance to verify coverage is actually tested (with note if question fails its intended purpose)
- Strengthened red/green flags to include coverage indicators (e.g., "mentions operational aspects" as green flag)

### Preservation of Strengths
- Kept all existing question requirements that scored 85+ (clarity, relevance, fairness)
- Maintained the 3-question structure and 10-minute constraint
- Preserved the focus on non-technical recruiter readability
- Kept the LLM-as-judge scoring approach
- Maintained the red/green flag framework (only enhanced it)
