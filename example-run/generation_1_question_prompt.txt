# Interview Question Set Design Prompt

## Role Being Hired For
Senior Go (Golang) Backend Engineer

## Interview Context
**This is a recruiter phone screen.**
- Questions will be asked by a non-technical recruiter reading from a script
- Questions must be simple to read aloud and understand
- 10-minute phone screen
- Scoring will be done by LLM-as-judge from the transcript

## Candidate Level
Senior (5+ years Go experience, 7+ years total engineering experience)

## What We Want to Learn
- Whether the candidate has genuine hands-on Go experience
- Basic understanding of Go's key concepts (concurrency, error handling)
- Production experience with Go services
- Ability to explain technical concepts clearly

## Question Requirements
- Exactly 3 scripted questions
- No follow-up questions (recruiter reads questions as-is)
- Questions must be easy for a non-technical person to read aloud
- Questions should allow candidates to demonstrate real experience
- Avoid jargon-heavy questions that are hard to pronounce or understand
- Questions should fit within ~10 minutes total (about 3 minutes per question)
- Question should require an appropriate level of technical detail for the time limit.
- **Questions must collectively cover: (1) hands-on Go project experience, (2) Go-specific concepts (concurrency OR error handling), (3) production deployment/operational considerations**

## Red Flags (for LLM scoring rubric)
- Cannot explain what they've built with Go
- Vague or generic answers that could apply to any language
- No mention of real projects or production experience
- Cannot articulate basic Go concepts in simple terms
- Answers that describe Go features without explaining why they matter
- No discussion of trade-offs or constraints

## Green Flags (for LLM scoring rubric)
- Specific examples from real projects with measurable context (team size, scale, timeline)
- Clear explanation of Go-specific features and why they matter
- Demonstrates understanding of Go's strengths and trade-offs
- Can explain technical concepts in accessible language
- Mentions concrete challenges encountered and how they were solved
- Discusses operational aspects (monitoring, debugging, deployment)

## Output Format
Provide a question set with:
- Exactly 3 clear, scripted questions
- Questions phrased for a non-technical recruiter to read aloud
- Time allocation (should sum to ~10 minutes)
- Explicit coverage map showing which question addresses which learning goal
- What to look for in answers (for LLM scoring)

The LLM scoring rubric should include:
- What a strong answer looks like
- What a weak answer looks like
- Specific signals to listen for
- **Transcript-matchable indicators** (concrete phrases, patterns, or details that signal competence level)
- **For each question: minimum viable evidence of competence** (what must be present for a passing score)
