# Interview Question Set Design Prompt

## Role Being Hired For
Senior Go (Golang) Backend Engineer

## Interview Context
**This is a technical interview.**
- Questions should assess deep Go expertise and backend engineering skills
- Focus on language features, concurrency, system design, and production experience
- 45-minute technical screen
- Scoring will be done by LLM-as-judge from the transcript

## Candidate Level
Senior (5+ years Go experience, 7+ years total engineering experience)

## What We Want to Learn
- Deep understanding of Go's concurrency model (goroutines, channels, select)
- Knowledge of Go idioms and best practices
- Experience with Go's type system, interfaces, and error handling
- Understanding of memory management and performance optimization
- Production experience with Go services at scale
- System design skills for backend services

## Technical Areas to Cover
- Goroutines, channels, and concurrency patterns
- Interface design and composition
- Error handling patterns
- Memory management and garbage collection
- Testing strategies (unit, integration, benchmarks)
- Common packages (context, sync, net/http, encoding/json)
- Database access patterns
- API design (REST, gRPC)
- Observability (logging, metrics, tracing)

## Question Requirements
- 4-5 technical questions
- Mix of conceptual and experience-based questions
- At least one question on concurrency
- At least one question on error handling or interfaces
- At least one system design or architecture question
- Follow-up questions that probe deeper understanding

## Red Flags (for LLM scoring rubric)
- Cannot explain goroutine vs thread differences
- Doesn't understand channel semantics or blocking behavior
- No awareness of common pitfalls (race conditions, goroutine leaks)
- Cannot articulate interface design principles
- No production debugging or performance optimization experience
- Unfamiliar with standard library packages
- Cannot discuss trade-offs in design decisions

## Green Flags (for LLM scoring rubric)
- Clear explanation of Go's concurrency model with examples
- Demonstrates understanding of when to use channels vs mutexes
- Discusses error handling strategies (wrapping, sentinel errors, custom types)
- Shows awareness of performance considerations
- Can discuss real production issues they've debugged
- Understands Go's philosophy (simplicity, composition over inheritance)
- Familiar with testing patterns including table-driven tests

## Output Format
Provide a complete question set with:
- Clear technical questions
- 2-3 follow-up questions that probe deeper
- Time allocation (should sum to ~40 minutes)
- What to look for in answers

The LLM scoring rubric should include:
- Technical accuracy requirements
- Depth of understanding indicators
- Specific signals for each score level
