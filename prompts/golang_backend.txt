# Interview Question Set Design Prompt

## Role Being Hired For
Senior Go (Golang) Backend Engineer

## Interview Context
**This is a recruiter screen, not a technical interview.**
- Non-technical recruiters will read these questions verbatim
- Recruiters CANNOT improvise—all questions and follow-ups must be scripted
- Questions must be easy to read aloud without technical background
- Scoring will be done later by LLM-as-judge from the transcript
- Focus on experience, approach, and communication—not coding ability
- 30-minute phone/video screen

## Candidate Level
Senior (5+ years Go experience, 7+ years total engineering experience)

## What We Want to Learn
- Does the candidate have genuine, hands-on Go experience?
- Can they explain technical concepts in accessible terms?
- Do they have relevant production experience?
- Are they a good communicator and collaborator?
- Do they show growth mindset and learning ability?

## Question Design Principles
- Questions should sound natural when read aloud by a non-engineer
- Avoid jargon in the question itself (candidate can use jargon in answers)
- Focus on "tell me about a time" and "how would you explain" formats
- Good answers will be recognizable even without technical expertise
- Look for: clarity, concrete examples, enthusiasm, self-awareness

## Question Requirements
- 3-4 questions total
- Questions a recruiter can confidently ask and understand responses to
- Focus on experience stories and communication ability
- At least one question about explaining technical concepts simply
- At least one question about working with others
- NO coding questions, NO whiteboard, NO technical problem-solving

## Red Flags (for LLM scoring rubric)
- Vague answers without specific examples
- Cannot explain their work in simple terms
- Dismissive of non-technical colleagues
- No concrete projects or contributions mentioned
- Blames others, doesn't take ownership
- Claims expertise but can't describe actual usage

## Green Flags (for LLM scoring rubric)
- Specific project examples with their role clearly explained
- Explains technical work in understandable analogies
- Shows enthusiasm when discussing their work
- Mentions collaboration and helping others
- Honest about challenges and what they learned
- Describes trade-offs and decisions they made

## Output Format
Provide a complete question set with:
- Clear question text that reads naturally aloud (script-ready)
- 2-3 scripted follow-up questions (recruiter will read these verbatim regardless of answer)
- Time allocation (should sum to ~25 minutes, leaving buffer for intro/questions)

The LLM scoring rubric should include:
- What distinguishes strong vs. weak answers
- Specific signals to look for in transcript
- Scoring criteria aligned with the skills we want to assess
