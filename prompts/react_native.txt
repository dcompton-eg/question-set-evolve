# Interview Question Set Design Prompt

## Role Being Hired For
Senior React Native Mobile Engineer

## Interview Context
**This is a recruiter phone screen.**
- Questions will be asked by a non-technical recruiter reading from a script
- Questions must be simple to read aloud and understand
- 10-minute phone screen
- Scoring will be done by LLM-as-judge from the transcript

## Candidate Level
Senior (4+ years React Native experience, 6+ years total engineering experience)

## What We Want to Learn
- Whether the candidate has genuine hands-on React Native experience (not just React web)
- Understanding of React Native's architecture (JS thread, native thread, bridge)
- Experience shipping mobile apps to App Store and/or Play Store
- Knowledge of mobile-specific challenges (performance, platform differences)
- Ability to explain technical concepts clearly

## Key React Native Concepts
- Bridge architecture and JS/native communication
- JS thread vs UI thread and performance implications
- Native modules and when to use them
- Platform-specific code (iOS vs Android differences)
- Performance optimization (FlatList, re-renders, Hermes engine)
- Mobile debugging tools (Flipper, React DevTools)

## Question Requirements
- Exactly 3 scripted questions
- No follow-up questions (recruiter reads questions as-is)
- Questions must be easy for a non-technical person to read aloud
- Questions should allow candidates to demonstrate real mobile app experience
- Avoid jargon-heavy questions that are hard to pronounce or understand
- Questions should fit within ~10 minutes total (about 3 minutes per question)

## Red Flags (for LLM scoring rubric)
- Cannot explain what mobile apps they've built with React Native
- Vague or generic answers that could apply to React web apps
- Confuses React Native with React web without acknowledging differences
- No mention of apps shipped to App Store or Play Store
- Cannot articulate React Native-specific concepts (bridge, native modules)
- No understanding of iOS vs Android platform differences

## Green Flags (for LLM scoring rubric)
- Specific examples from real mobile apps shipped to production
- Clear explanation of React Native-specific features (bridge, native modules, Hermes)
- Demonstrates understanding of mobile-specific challenges (performance, offline, battery)
- Can explain the difference between React web and React Native
- Mentions React Native debugging tools (Flipper, Metro bundler)
- Discusses platform-specific considerations (iOS vs Android)
- Provides quantifiable metrics (app ratings, crash rates, startup time, downloads)

## Output Format
Provide a question set with:
- Exactly 3 clear, scripted questions
- Questions phrased for a non-technical recruiter to read aloud
- Time allocation (should sum to ~10 minutes)
- What to look for in answers (for LLM scoring)

The LLM scoring rubric should include:
- What a strong answer looks like
- What a weak answer looks like
- Specific signals to listen for
- React Native-specific concepts that indicate genuine mobile experience
